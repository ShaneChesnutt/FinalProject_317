Final Project for Cpsc 317

This project is a multi-player RGP turn based battle game written in html/javascript/php this game is not fully 
completed because it still has some bugs but the game does function.


Bug List:

Cannot support large amounts of players on the server due the fact that files need to be cleared and delete after sessions
have been created

Needs:

Unique game sessions
Deletion of playerfiles
New attack system with character attributes counting towards different dynamics (Damage, dodging, etc)
